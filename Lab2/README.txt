Lab 2: Simple Path Data 
Files: Lab2.lgi

Instructions To Run Code:
1) Open Multimedia Logic
2) Then open Lab2.lgi
3) Click on the green arrow on the top left for simulation
4) Then first thing need to click on the clear button to see if the clear button work.
5)Then choose any number u like on the keypad as your input value.
6)then go to write register address switches and choose which register you want the value to be appear.
7)Repeat the process from step 4 to 5 for testing ALU output, but this time you will need to use Read address 1 and 2 for ALU input 1 and 2
8) For the store selector, test it with 0 which mean it will take value from key pad, and 1 mean it will take value from ALU output.
9) After finished simulation click on red rectangle to stop simulation.
